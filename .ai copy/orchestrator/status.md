# Cross-Project Status

Last updated: 2026-02-15 (Direction shift: OpenClaw brain/body split; Wave 4 added)

## Direction Shift: OpenClaw Integration

**Decision date:** 2026-02-15
**Decision:** Shift from monolithic in-process agent system to brain/body split with OpenClaw.
**Brief:** [direction-shift-openclaw-integration.md](briefs/orchestrator/2026-02/direction-shift-openclaw-integration.md)
**Impact:** New OC- task series (OC-1 through OC-5) added as Wave 4. Studio workflow canvas, credentials, execution history, and agent library deprioritized (replaced by Kimi Claw). All existing Wave 1-3 work continues unchanged (body-side).

---

## Current Sprint

**[2026-02-studio-game-alignment](sprints/2026-02-studio-game-alignment/master.md)**

Wire Studio to the game schema (NPC Builder, Integrations, Dashboard stats) while the game repo introduces modular skill plugins and the Photographer NPC. Keep the shared Supabase database aligned.

See [master.md](sprints/2026-02-studio-game-alignment/master.md) for full backlog, dependencies, and execution waves.

---

## FOUNDATION GATE

> **Wave 2+ work is HELD until the foundation pipeline is verified.**
> See [foundation.md](foundation.md) for the pipeline doc and verification checklist.
> See [alignment-rules.md §10](directives/alignment-rules.md) for the directive.
>
> **Known blockers:**
> 1. Game loads NPC configs from YAML, not Supabase — G-0 must ship.
> 2. TMX-to-DB sync (G-5) must ship so full pipeline (Tiled → DB → Game) is testable.
> PM runs verification after both, then signs off.

## Execution Waves

### Wave 1 — DONE
- **Studio (Lovable):** S-1, S-2, S-3 — CODE MERGED, briefs reframed as verify & polish
- **Game (Cursor):** G-0, G-1, D-6, tmx-enrich, G-5, G-6 — DONE
- **Game (Cursor):** G-7 → G-8 (In-game builder persistence + config form) — after D-6 + G-0, briefs to write
- **DB (Orchestrator):** D-4 (Audit seed data + reconcile grants) — TODO

### FOUNDATION GATE — PM verified; Wave 2 unblocked

### Wave 2 — In Progress
- **Game:** G-2 (Photographer NPC) — DONE
- **Studio:** S-4 (Memory Viewer, after foundation gate)
- **Studio:** S-6 (Map Entity Browser, after D-6 — can start pre-gate)
- **DB:** ~~D-5~~ **DONE** — migration 013 designed, ready to apply

### Wave 3 — UNBLOCKED (D-5 done, G-2 done) — body-side content pipeline
- **Game:** G-3 (Content Store — apply migration 013, implement ContentStore.ts), then G-4 (Social Feed)
- **Studio:** S-5 (Feed Integration, after G-4)

### Wave 4 — OpenClaw Integration (parallel with Wave 3) — brain-side
- **Ops:** OC-1 (BYOC Setup)
- **Game:** OC-2 (Webhook Bridge) + OC-3 (SKILL.md Files) — after OC-1
- **Game:** OC-4 (Config Schema + Migration 014) — after OC-2 + OC-3
- **Studio:** OC-5 (OpenClaw UI Integration) — after OC-4

## Game Repo Status (from Open-RPG/.ai/status.md)

- Sprints 0-4: DONE
- Sprint 5 (API-as-Identity + Social): NEXT — G-1 is the first task
- Sprint 2 (LLM Gateway): BACKLOG (deferred to Studio integration)
- Sprint 6 (Evaluation Arena): BACKLOG
- **NPC config loading: currently YAML-based, not Supabase-based (G-0 needed)**

## Studio Repo Status

- Application shell: Complete
- Canvas / workflow builder: **DEPRIORITIZED** (replaced by Kimi Claw UI)
- **Game integration: NPC Builder, Integrations, Dashboard stats — all MERGED to main**
- Studio writes to Supabase correctly; game-side reading is the gap
- Next Studio work: verify/polish merged code; S-4 held until foundation gate; OC-5 adds OpenClaw mode toggle

## Database Status

- `game` schema: Live, 4 tables, seed data (4 NPCs, 1 integration)
- Cross-schema grants: Applied (migration 011); Studio's overly-broad migration needs reconciliation (D-4)
- PostgREST: `public`, `studio`, `game` exposed
- **Applied: migration 012 (map_entities + map_metadata)** — D-6 DONE
- **Designed: migration 013 (npc_content + content_tags + npc_posts + recall_content RPC)** — D-5 DONE, Cursor to apply with G-3
- **Planned: migration 014 (openclaw_agent_mode)** — adds `agent_mode`, `openclaw_agent_id`, `openclaw_webhook_url` to `agent_configs` (OC-4)
